## Sample Data

The `context/openapi-sample.json` file contains a real Adobe Events Service API with:
- 50+ entities
- Complex relationships
- Nested objects and arrays
- Various data types

The `sample-diagram.json` file contains a simpler e-commerce schema with:
- User management
- Order processing
- Profile information
- Clear relationships

## Tips

1. **Start simple**: Import the sample diagram first to understand the interface
2. **Use the properties panel**: Click entities to edit them in detail
3. **Connect relationships**: Drag between entities to show how they relate
4. **Save your work**: Use the export feature to backup your diagrams
5. **Explore the OpenAPI sample**: Import the large schema to see the parser in action

## Troubleshooting

- **Import not working?** Make sure your JSON file is valid
- **Entities not showing?** Check the browser console for errors
- **Can't connect entities?** Make sure you're dragging from the edge of one entity to another
- **Properties panel not opening?** Click directly on the entity, not just near it
